    "## 1. Definitions: Knowledge, Memory, and Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation details, we need to establish a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of our course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of generative AI has evolved rapidly from simple language models to sophisticated agentic systems. This evolution has been marked by increasing capabilities in knowledge retrieval, memory utilization, and autonomous decision-making. Understanding these core concepts is essential for building effective AI systems that can assist with complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by exploring the fundamental definitions and relationships between knowledge, memory, and agents in AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge in AI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Knowledge**: Information that AI systems can access and utilize to perform tasks, answer questions, and make decisions. It represents the \"what\" of AI understanding - facts, concepts, and relationships that the system knows about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Knowledge in AI\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems access knowledge through two primary mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric Knowledge**  \n",
    "Information encoded directly within the model's weights during training. This knowledge is \"baked into\" the model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Parametric Knowledge**  \n",
    "Information stored outside the model's parameters, typically in external databases or knowledge bases that can be queried at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parametric Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Parametric Knowledge:**\n",
    "- Stored within the model's parameters (weights and biases)\n",
    "- Fixed after training (without fine-tuning or retraining)\n",
    "- Fast to access, as it requires no external lookup\n",
    "- May become outdated as the world changes\n",
    "- Limited by model size and training data\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when a large language model (LLM) knows that \"Paris is the capital of France\" without looking it up externally, it's using parametric knowledge stored in its weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Non-Parametric Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Non-Parametric Knowledge:**\n",
    "- Stored in external systems (databases, knowledge graphs, documents)\n",
    "- Can be updated without retraining the model\n",
    "- Requires retrieval mechanisms (search, lookup)\n",
    "- Easily expandable without changing the model itself\n",
    "- May increase latency due to retrieval time\n",
    "\n",
    "When an AI system looks up current weather data or retrieves information from a company's database, it's utilizing non-parametric knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Knowledge Representation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "How knowledge is represented significantly impacts how AI systems can use it. Common knowledge representation methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Embeddings**  \n",
    "Represent concepts, words, or documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, where semantic similarity is captured by vector proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Graphs**  \n",
    "Structured representations of knowledge as a network of entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symbolic Representations**  \n",
    "Formal logical structures that enable reasoning through rules and relationships, often using predicate logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed Representations**  \n",
    "Information distributed across many parameters, as in neural networks, where knowledge is represented implicitly across connections.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Memory in AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Memory**: An AI system's ability to store and recall past experiences, interactions, or computational states to maintain context and influence future behavior. Memory enables persistence and continuity in AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differentiating Memory from Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "While knowledge and memory are related concepts, they serve different functions in AI systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge vs. Memory:**\n",
    "- **Knowledge** is about factual information and understanding of concepts (the \"what\")\n",
    "- **Memory** is about recording experiences and context over time (the \"when\" and \"how\")\n",
    "- **Knowledge** might tell an AI about calendar systems and how dates work\n",
    "- **Memory** helps an AI remember that the user scheduled a meeting last Tuesday\n",
    "\n",
    "This distinction becomes particularly important when designing AI systems that need to maintain context across multiple interactions with users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Memory in AI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems implement several forms of memory, inspired by human cognitive systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term Memory (Working Memory)**  \n",
    "Temporary storage for ongoing conversations or tasks, typically limited in scope and duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Episodic Memory**  \n",
    "Records specific past experiences and interactions, similar to how humans remember events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Memory**  \n",
    "Stores structured factual knowledge, definitions, and rules about specific domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedural Memory**  \n",
    "Contains information about how to perform tasks or follow processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term Memory**\n",
    "- Storing recent conversation turns in context window\n",
    "- Maintaining state within a session\n",
    "- Tracking active goals and subtasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Episodic Memory**\n",
    "- Conversation logs with timestamps\n",
    "- Interaction history databases\n",
    "- Vector databases of past exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic Memory**\n",
    "- Knowledge graphs of user preferences\n",
    "- Structured databases of learned facts\n",
    "- Vector stores of semantic information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedural Memory**\n",
    "- Stored procedures or functions\n",
    "- Task templates and workflows\n",
    "- Learned patterns for multi-step processes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of Memory for AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory capabilities are essential for creating persistent, context-aware AI agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuity**  \n",
    "Enables coherent multi-turn interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalization**  \n",
    "Allows agents to adapt to individual users over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning**  \n",
    "Provides experiences from which to improve performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship Building**  \n",
    "Creates a sense of persistence and familiarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Task Management**  \n",
    "Supports handling of multi-stage processes\n",

    "\n",
    "### Agents in Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Agents**: Autonomous systems that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents use generative models as their reasoning engine while incorporating additional capabilities for interaction and task completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components of AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI agents typically consist of several interdependent components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Perception**  \n",
    "Mechanisms for receiving and processing input from the environment or users.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:* Natural language understanding, vision systems, data connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Reasoning**  \n",
    "Cognitive capabilities for understanding, planning, and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:* LLMs for reasoning, planning systems, domain-specific models\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Memory**  \n",
    "Systems for storing and retrieving past experiences and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:* Short-term context, long-term storage, episodic records\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Action**  \n",
    "Capabilities for executing decisions and interacting with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:* Tool usage (APIs), text generation, database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evolution from Basic LLMs to Agentic Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The progression from simple language models to agentic systems represents a significant evolution in AI capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Basic Language Models**  \n",
    "Generate text based on prompts without agency or persistence.\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "LLM: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
